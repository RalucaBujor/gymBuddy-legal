Privacy Policy
Last updated 22 January 2024

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how GymBuddy (“the App”, “we”, “our”) handles user data. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

2. Information We Collect
GymBuddy does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.
All data entered by the user is stored locally on the device only.
The App may allow users to manually enter fitness-related information, including but not limited to:
* workout descriptions
* exercise names
* weights
* repetitions
* rest times
* training notes
This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us.

3. HealthKit
The App integrates with Apple HealthKit to read and/or write workout-related data only with the user’s explicit permission.
Health data accessed via HealthKit:
* is used solely to provide app functionality
* is stored locally on the device
* is never transmitted to external servers
* is never shared with third parties
* is never used for advertising or tracking purposes
Health data is handled in compliance with Apple’s HealthKit policies.

4. Live Activities
The App uses Live Activities to display ongoing workout information on the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island.
Live Activities data:
* is generated locally on the device
* is temporary and session-based
* is not collected, stored externally, or shared

5. Data Storage
All user data is stored locally on the user’s device using Apple’s secure storage mechanisms. We do not operate servers and do not back up user data externally.
Deleting the App will permanently remove all stored data.

6. Third-Party Services
The App does not use:
* third-party analytics
* advertising networks
* tracking technologies
* external data processors

7. Data Security
We rely on iOS system-level security features to protect locally stored data. No method of electronic storage is 100% secure, but we take reasonable measures to protect user information.

8. User Rights
Because we do not collect or store personal data externally:
* there is no personal data for us to access, modify, or delete
* users have full control over their data on their device

9. Children’s Privacy
The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
